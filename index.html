                    Hello and welcome to my Website, My name is Ewan Walker (thats me on the right in the following image!) Im currently studying at Newcastle university doing computer science, i have a passion for Artificial intellegence, 
                    Web Development as well as Data Analytics. Outside of studying and going to university i love to climb, play football and spend time in nature.

                <h1>Why Build This Website?</h1>
                <h2>
                    In the summer of 2024 I participated in a summer exchange program to The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and studied astro physics aswell as persued my own research on neural networks 
                    and artificial intellegence. During my time studying in Hong Kong I decided to completely overhaul my previously deralict and unused website and turn it into a
                    proffesional and functional space to show off my research projects, portfolio of past work as well as show off a little bit about myself. i took it upon myself
                    to use the google web.dev archive and teach myself the intricacies of web development and in turn I have developed this website to be both stylish, functional and accesible for a wide range if users.
