                    <p> 
                        I am going to explore Neural Networks they were curated and why followed by building my very first neural network using python, i intend to collate all the knowlege i gather on the way here. i want to know what they are, how they work and why they are so useful in the modern day technological era.

                    <h2>The Neuron and Perceptron</h2>
                    <p> 
                        A neural network is a recreation of a animals nervous system within a computer attempting to imitate brain functionality,
                        it consists of "perceptrons" which are a inspired by neurons, within an animal a neuron transmits electrical signals across the body both to and from the brain. The perceptron was first theorised in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, followed by the first version built on a computer by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 which was very similar to neurons as they were presented by Nobel Prize laureate Cajal whom was the very first person to have evidence that neurons are seperate showing there are multiple neurons congregated together, each working independantly using signals from eachother.
                        <br> <br>
                        A perceptron as introduced by Frank Rosenblatt was originally intended to be a machine, funded by the us navy and was able to detect different shapes, thus computer vision was born
